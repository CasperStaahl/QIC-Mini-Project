\section{Introduction}

The task is to use Grover's algorithm to implement a SAT solver.

In \autoref{sec:state-of-the-art}, we introduce the state of the art for Grover's algorithm, specifically Grover's algorithm for problems with an unknown number of solutions.
In \autoref{sec:method}, we give a high-level view of the algorithm.
In \autoref{sec:implementation}, we describe the implementation in more detail and give examples of the test cases that we included to ensure correctness.
In \autoref{sec:simulations}, we describe the strategy for simulation and results collecting, further, we present the results.
In \autoref{sec:hardware-execution}, we present the results of the hardware execution.
In \autoref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the results from the two previous sections.
Finally, in \autoref{sec:conclusion}, we give our concluding remarks.
