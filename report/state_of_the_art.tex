\section{State of the Art}\label{sec:state-of-the-art}
Grover's algorithm is a promising unstructured search algorithm that takes advantage of our understanding of quantum computers.
When searching for a single solution, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal with a worst case of $O\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$, making it quadratically faster than classical computing~\cite{Grover}.

The quadratic speedup is possible mainly because of the so-called amplitude amplification technique.
The main idea of this is to amplify the amplitude, hence increasing the probability, of the desired states, while also lowering the amplitude of undesired states.
This is further explained in~\cite{Brassard, Grover}.

In this paper though, we will be focusing on applying the algorithm to a search problem with an unknown amount of solutions.
This case is described in~\cite{Boyer_1998}, and is almost certain to find a solution every time with a worst case of $O\left(\sqrt{N/t}\right)$, where $t$ is the amount of solutions.
