## Introduction

I will try to use Grover's Algorithm to make our abstract interpretation framework SQAAL more precise.
In particular we will for some Boolean expression over some abstract values try to find more specific abstract values that are contained within the original abstract values that make the Boolean expression still evaluate to some abstract value that contains true.
The idea is then to use Grover's Algorithm to search for such abstract values, given some Boolean expression over some abstract values.
