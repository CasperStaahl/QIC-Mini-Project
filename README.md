# QIC-Mini-Project

## Introduction

The task is to use Grover's algorithm to implement a tautology/contradiction checker for zeroth-order propositions.
Further I want to use this to implement a reachability analysis for a simple while programming language if I have the time.

## State of the art

## Method

## Implementation in Qiskit

## Simulations

## Hardware execution

## Discussion of simulation and hardware results

## Conclusions
